# The Project
Allows the user to either be linked to a random Wikipedia article or search Wikipedia and be returned search results based on their input. Once the user has submitted their search request, the page loads the top 10 results detailing the title, a short text overview on that topic as well as a link for the users to click through to the main Wikipedia page.
